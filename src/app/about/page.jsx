      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        I'm Ujjwal Bansal, a passionate coder and lifelong learner. My
        journey began with a curiosity about how technology shapes our lives. I
        pursued a Bachelor's in Maths (BSC) and am currently
        completing my Master's in Computer Applications (MCA) at ABES
        Engineering College, Ghaziabad.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Throughout my journey, I've developed skills in various programming
        languages and frameworks, including Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Nextjs.
        I love sharing what I've learned and helping others on their coding
        journeys.
